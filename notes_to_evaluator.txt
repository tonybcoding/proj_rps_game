Dear Evaluator,

This project (and this added lesson) were just what I’ve been looking for. I’ve been programming for years, but after moving to product management in the early 2000s, I never picked up object-oriented design and programming. I took this project as an opportunity to really learn, so it is quite longer than was called for.

Beyond the project rubric, I wanted to test my OO skills. Here’s the idea of the game:

Display introduction
Set up game by asking several questions:
* Type of game: Set Rounds or Best of Rounds
* Enter the number of rounds.
** If Best of Rounds was selected, the number must be odd
* Select whether you want to play a computer player or have the computer player play another computer player
* For computer players, let the user decide which type, or “Surprise me!” by letting the computer pick the type
* The computer then plays the rounds
** ties are not permitted, and the computer will replay the round
* The game ends when either the number of rounds are hit or, if Best Of Rounds selected, over half have been won
* The displays each round and the final tally
* I also added a player that "learns" based off very rudimentary analysis of past winning moves with a bit of randomness thrown in.

This was a great project! I look forward to your review.

Best regards,
Tony
